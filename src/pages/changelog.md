The pedagogical structure took shape with concrete workshop plans. We moved from theory to practice:

- First semester: students become experts in their own subject
- Second semester: translating work for external audiences
- Workshop series covering print form, publication possibilities, technology, and community engagement
- Exploring how to deliver research through accessible, shareable means
- Developing frameworks for showing students examples and inspiring expanded thinking
- Non-book publications and experimental formats
- Affordances as big chapters with descriptions, writings on histories, related readings, tutorials, precedents, and gesture experiments

The presentation itself needed to embody hybrid publishing principles. We organized affordances as the organizing structure. Key question emerged: is the workshop more of a show and tell, or a deep dive into the framework itself?

This phase emphasized that workshops should introduce but not fully develop the framework, leaving room for student interpretation and extension.

As the framework solidified, new questions emerged that would shape later development:

- The translation towards material forms
- Whether all affordances must always be true for work to be interesting
- Licensing conversations within ownability section
- The difference between creator intent and user appropriation
- How personal blogs changed our relationship to publishing
- The centralization of the web through platforms post-Web 2
- Distinguishing adaptability from updatability and reactivity
- The role of feedback loops in publishing
- RSS feeds and API structures for publishing

Key conceptual refinements: changing the framework versus the framework being reactive to users. We began eliminating sequentiality and exploring switching indexing systems between print and digital. The project itself could become the index/catalog. Being able to hide information anywhere and in anything.

This phase deepened our understanding of how historical forces shaped contemporary publishing:

- The concept that the early internet was designed as an index, not a container
- How translations from analogue to digital have evolved throughout internet history
- The distinction between early internet practices and current Web 2 approaches
- Our changing relationship to reading and how it changes our relationship to the web
- The energy and constant maintenance required for websites versus the self-sustaining existence of books
- The energy and flows of life constantly changing web content

Questions about reading shifted our approach: how our habits change, how relationships to indexing and searching have evolved, how our relationship to impermanence shapes publishing practices.

The next step became clear: we needed explicit definitions for the affordances and a working framework that could evolve with our research body.

The affordances framework became increasingly sophisticated. We began:

- Defining opposite affordances and what it means when an affordance is false
- Clarifying affordances through their negation and counter-examples
- Pulling examples from our database to illustrate each concept
- Building a medium list from collected projects
- Placing affordances in context of standard versus non-standard media use
- Researching the history and parallel evolution of affordances

Crucial realization: tools are only as interesting as their contents. We started exploring why it matters for content to exist as a book versus a website versus a presentation, emphasizing containers and content relationships. Questions emerged: why does content need to be translated? How is it translated? What gets omitted or created to fit different kinds of containers? Can the research itself be the content?

A critical refinement occurred when we recognized that applying formats to vague concepts was ineffective. Instead, we separated formats and qualities into distinct organizational systems:

- Using affordances as one categorization system with format as secondary
- Differentiating between process and final form
- Using binary organization (linear/nonlinear) to define opposites
- Treating affordances as ways to move between formats
- Understanding that attributes maintain meaning across different formats
- Recognizing that what we bring to the table is projects that blur these lines

Our framework shifted from black and white thinking to embracing blurry dichotomies. We stopped thinking of digital and physical as opposites and started thinking of them as interrelated systems. The attributes of a medium should have meaning in different ways across formats.

By early October, we began connecting the index concept to existing platforms and tools students already use:

- Exploring collective databases and how search features create feedback loops between system and viewer
- Investigating the authorship of the reader and how feedback creates dialogue
- Considering how to source and scavenge from individual databases to build collective ones
- Thinking about sharing mechanisms: collective are.na boards, periodic scraping, feeding into larger systems
- The complicated hierarchy of information organization
- A small world with infinite possibilities expanding beyond borders

The role of the viewer and reader in creating meaning became increasingly important. We started recognizing that the research could take multiple forms for distribution, and that gathering and organization itself creates space for dialogue.

The initial exploration phase focused on fundamental questions about publishing in the hybrid era. We began defining the core qualities that differentiate publishing practices:

- Clarifying what it means to publish versus archive as separate questions
- Exploring digital publishing beyond the free-standing website
- Publishing through established systems (Google Calendar)
- Considering book versioning at extreme levels
- Discussing formats for distributing research and ideas
- Developing frameworks for translating media between forms
- The idea of a guide to virtual/web spaces
- The premium collectible version of the digital thing becoming the published artifact

The question "What does it mean to present these ideas to students?" became central to our pedagogical approach. We also began summarizing important findings and sourcing interesting resources that could inform the research.
