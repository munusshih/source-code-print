title: Ownability
description: "The ability for work to be permanently owned by readers and accessed without interruption, regardless of future changes by publishers or platforms."

Ownability addresses fundamental questions of access versus ownership in contemporary publishing. When you "own" a digital book, do you actually possess it? Can it be removed from your library? Updated without your consent? Made inaccessible if a platform shuts down? The counter to ownability is subscription models, licensing, and sole proprietary control, where access is temporary and conditional.

## The Ownership Question

The shift from ownership to access represents one of the most significant transformations in publishing. Physical books are ownable: if you put a book in your library, no one can remove it unless you make that decision. A standard website is not ownable: the host platform could decide to unpublish it at any time, and while you might still have the link, you can no longer access the content.

This distinction became urgent with the rise of platform capitalism and centralized web infrastructure. As documented by projects like <u>[Steve, Harvey and Matt](https://epa.archive.work)</u>, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed 1,964 climate change related URLs from EPA.gov in April 2017, access to two decades of scientific information vanished overnight. The project responded by capturing and printing these articles, questioning the "ownability" of information on the web. While published on the web, reader access to those articles was conditional and fragile. But when the articles are printed, their distribution is a more permanent act. The book can be owned and stored solely by the reader, making interference from the publisher impossible.

Before Web 2.0, things were decentralized. With Web 2.0, everything became hosted on platforms, introducing new vulnerabilities. When readers access work through platforms rather than owning copies, they are subject to platform decisions about availability, pricing, and even content. This question of ownability extends beyond readers to creators: Who gets to own the publishing process and results? What tools is the work built on? Who made the tools? Who is maintaining them? Can you adapt or hack the tools to your benefit?

The ownability question extends to the infrastructure itself. Projects built on open source libraries like <u>[p5.js](https://p5js.org)</u>, maintained by thousands of global contributors, offer different ownership possibilities than proprietary software. The PrePostPrint network highlights experimental publications made with <u>[free software](https://prepostprint.org/resources/)</u>, emphasizing that ownability extends to the tools themselves. When publishing tools are open source, creators own not just their content but their means of production.

## Precedents and Approaches

<u>[E-Book Backup](https://p-dpa.net/work/e-book-backup/)</u> from <u>[P—DPA](https://p-dpa.net)</u> examines backing up digital books in physical form as a response to the precariousness of digital ownership. <u>[Library of the Printed Web](https://libraryoftheprintedweb.tumblr.com)</u> documents the practice of printing internet content to ensure its continued existence independent of servers and platforms.

Grassroots archival practices preserve works that might otherwise be lost when commercial interests shift. What are the terms of ownership? Is this open source? To what degree? MIT license? Creative Commons? What rights do readers actually have? Bootleg libraries and community archives act as safety nets, though they raise complex questions about legality and access.

<u>[Book Your Own Fuckin' Life](https://archive.org/details/byofl_01/page/n25/mode/2up)</u> (1992) represents early DIY publishing practices that prioritized reader ownership and distribution outside commercial channels. These practices emphasized that who owns the work, to what level, and under what terms matters fundamentally for how it circulates and sustains.

Can readers download and keep the work permanently? Can they customize it based on accessibility needs? Can they edit it? Can the work be viewed locally without internet connectivity or platform dependencies? These questions of permanence, portability, and control define what ownership truly means in different contexts.

## Ownership Strategies

Projects exploring ownability focus on making ownership explicit and permanent. Download and keep approaches provide files readers can store permanently on their own devices, not just stream or access through platforms. Editable formats distribute work in formats readers can modify, adapt, or customize according to their needs. Self hosting enables work to be viewed locally without internet connectivity or platform dependencies. Open licensing using Creative Commons, copyleft, or public domain licenses clarifies what readers can do with the work. Redundant distribution publishes through multiple channels to ensure continued access even if individual platforms fail. Tool transparency builds with open source tools and documents dependencies so the work can be reconstructed if platforms disappear.
