title: Updatability
description: 'The ability to keep changing and adapting work even after it has been "published."'

Updatability challenges the notion that publication marks the end point of creation. Rather than viewing published work as immutable and complete, updatability asks: what if work could continue to evolve, respond to feedback, incorporate new information, or adapt to changing contexts even after initial release? The counter to updatability is immutability, where published work remains fixed in its original state.

## Web Evolution and Real Time Publishing

The distinction between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 fundamentally centers on updatability. Web 1.0 was described as "read only" websites, static pages that remained unchanged after posting. Web 2.0 introduced "read and write" websites that change as users interact with them: chatrooms, forums, collaborative documents, social platforms. This shift opened entirely new publishing possibilities.

The technologies enabling this transformation were AJAX and APIs, essentially ways to communicate with servers and directly update content in real time. These technologies gave birth to customer facing content management systems, platform capitalism, and increasingly centralized web content. Technically, nothing is truly immutable. Even printed books have editions, errata slips, newspaper subscription models. The difference lies in how visible and central the update mechanism becomes to the work itself.

The key question becomes: who is updating it? Is the work updated by the creator alone, or does it receive community input? Google Docs represents perhaps the most familiar example of updatability: a living document that can be edited by anyone who comes across it on the internet, with no authentication required. The content cannot be differentiated from the framework—the tool itself enables and shapes what kinds of updates are possible.

Who controls the updates? Are updates made solely by the original author, or can readers contribute, correct, extend, or remix the work? How are updates distributed? When work is updated, how do readers access the new version? Do they need to download again, visit a new URL, or does the change propagate automatically? Are previous versions preserved? Can readers see what changed and why? Is there version control?

## Precedents and Methods

<u>[A Party to Print](https://raphaelbastide.com/workshops/a-party-to-print/)</u> explores generative updatability, where the interactions of a party actively create content for a book as the party is happening. The work updates in real time based on participant contributions. The PrePostPrint network documents alternative publishing tools and workflows that emphasize collaboration and ongoing evolution. The network itself is updatable, growing as new tools and practices emerge.

<u>[Cyberfeminism Index](https://cyberfeminismindex.com)</u> functions as a constantly evolving archive, with new entries and connections added over time. The work is never "finished" but continues to grow and adapt. Tools like Notion and similar collaborative platforms function as publishing tools with built in updatability, tracking who edited what and when, enabling different progress states like "approved" or "sent back to discussion."

Projects exploring updatability employ modular editions that create content in discrete modules that can be updated, replaced, or reordered without republishing the entire work. Incomplete layouts design with empty spaces or flexible structures that anticipate future additions. Adaptable containers use modular binding systems or flexible formats that allow new sections to be inserted. Visible versioning makes version numbers, changelog, or update history central to the work's presentation. Collective authorship enables multiple contributors to add, edit, or extend content over time. RSS feeds and APIs publish work in formats that allow automated updates and syndication across platforms. The question of how the form adapts versus how the content updates remains central: does the form adapt while the content stays fixed, or do they both evolve together?
