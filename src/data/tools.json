In effect Paged.js acts as a polyfill for the CSS modules to print content using features that are not yet natively supported by browsers. Paged.js is a community driven project, we’ll make sure that anyone feels just like at home, newcomers and old friends alike. We’ll always put the community needs first: we have a Mattermost that we use to discuss everything and the development is hosted on github. All the issues are read and answered as fast as possible.",
