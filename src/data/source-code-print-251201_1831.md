The energy and flows of life constantly changing web content

the constant energy that goes into maintaining a website vs the self-sustaining existence of a book

next step: clear definitions for the affordances and the framework

Framework wll probably evolve as the body of work evolves but will be beneficial to

connect examples to definitions

Gestures and frameworks

## 111025

- Reader vs user (assumptions of passivity) 

- Think about formats to deliver the research

- How can this research become a lecture

- If the first semester is about you becoming a expert of your own subject the second semester is about translating this to an external audience

- Making work accessible through shareable means (book, presentation, exhibition) 

- Workshops from the faculty to lead the co-hort to think about the ways to translate their work into book making

- 1st week (Asad workshop on the printed form, conceptually)

- Christina workshop on upending what a publication can be

- (optional indesign workshop is a separate thing)

- Dyer has a printing/paper logistics information session

- Matt workshop on technology and print (might not happen)

- Emilio and Alex Community engagement in the context of the printed form (Kimi then reinterpreted this as a more performance based workshop)

- These all privileged print as a hard focus

- Opportunity to approach this from a more digital view of things 

- How can we deliver this in a workshop format

- non-book publications

- Showing students a framework of thought and archive of references

- Go through examples in an attempt to inspire and extend thoughts around what a digital/print project can look like

- The presentation should also be digital/print

- Can we print out some of the examples

- Affordances as big 'chapters'

    - description 

    - writings on histories

    - related readings

    - tutorials

    - precedents

    - gesture experiments

- Is the workshop more of a show and tell

- the affordances can be more in the repository

- Is the example or the tutorial more important??

- introduce but not fully develop the affordances framework during the workshop

- Source some tutorials

- gestures are taking a littleral transaction of one medium to another

- through the translation of the medium it is not about recreating the experience through print but extending it through print

Some affordances! Maybe this is the way to go for organizing moving forward.

- personalization / a11y

- version control / documenting

- interactivity

- feedback / response

- contribution / sourcing

- hyperlinks / nonlinear

- automation / hacking exiting tools

## Theoretical Framework (Affordances)

**The possibilities for action offered to a person by a medium**

In their genesis, physical and digital media were assigned certain affordances that seemed inseparable from their form (ie: a book is always material, a website is always searchable), but in an era where digital and physical media are deeply intertwined, hybrid publishing practices create bridges between these media by translating the affordances inherent to one medium to another.

By identifying what these affordances are and the processes by which previous hybrid publishing practices have translated them across media, we hope to better understand what it means to  produce, circulate, and receive  work that is truly 'hybrid'

### Possible Media

- **Print**

- Web

- Video

- Audio

- Processes 

    - tools, documenation, interviews 

- Materials

- Experience (UX)

    - board games, behavioral experiemnents

- Object

- **Writting/Research**

- Data

- **Performance/Presentation**

- **Exhibition**

## Materiality

The ability to derive meaning from what can be observed or touched in the material that a work is made of

- What material/format can this method be published/circulate in? What are some materialistic attributes that we can considering? Could we experiment with other materials? How hard is it to adopt to other format/material? 

- Projects that gives publishing a tangible form. However, the project also should encourages explorations in what material it takes, how it takes and what flexibility this might brings.

- For instance, could the same book be printed in 5 different ratios. In <u>Print Local Sell Local</u>, the model is that they would send editable pdf to publishers so they can adjust the sizing to local paper sizes before printing. Each variation is intentionally different.

- Or can the project thinks about all different sides of the book (artifact?) A book is also a visualization and also a sculpture. 

- For instance, in p5.zine, the act of being able to quickly lay the page out into printable 8 page zine that anyone can easily print out on their own paper using any digital printer. The immediacy of giving this digital file a material format, makes it a hybrid publishing tool.

- Or projects that only makes sense when combining with material, for instance, p5.riso

- Counter word: **Intangible**

### Examples 

- The experience of a book that is determined by the type of paper and the size/form at which it is printed

- The experience of an exhibition that is determined by the material of the environement (the ground, the walls, the artwork etc...)

## Ownability

The ability for a work to be permanently owned by its viewer and accessed without interruption, regardless of future input from the original publisher or circulator

- Who gets to own this book? And to what levels of ownership? Do we get to own our publishing progress and results? How precarious is our current possessions?

- To audience: can they download the book and own it? Can they even customize the book based on their a11y needs and even edit it?

- Licensing? Is this open source? To what degrees? MIT? CC?

- To creator: What tools is this built on? Who gets to edit and access the original file? Who made the tools? Who's maintaining the tool? Can we adapt/hack the tools to our benefits? What are some community inputs/plugins that have already been developed?

- For p5.zine, the project is built on top of an open sourced creative coding library that's maintained by thousands of contributors globally. It's also using web technologies, which makes it super easy for adding in plugins or adding new features.

- It's also hosted on web platforms, so others can easily download, remix or fork the zines. However, if it's not self hosted, it relies on the bigger web infrastructure to work. 

- \- can it be viewed locally?

- Counter word:  **Sole-proprietary / Licensing / Subscription Model**

### Examples 

- A book is ownable, because if you put it in your library, no one can remove it from your library unless you make the decision to physically remove it

- A (standard) website is not ownable because the host platform could decide to unpublish the webiste at anytime. Here the viewer even though the might still have the link, would then no longer be able to access the website.

## Updatability

The ability to keep changing and adapting a work even after it has been 'published'

Technically, nothing is NOT updatable. But this reminds me of the difference between WEB 1 and WEB 2. Web 1 is being described as "read-only" websites, where Web 2 is read and write websites that changes as the user interact with it, such as chatrooms, forums and etc. This certainly opens up a whole new possibilities of publishing. 

The technologies that enables it are AJAX and APIs, basically a way to talk to the server and directly update the site in realtime. This also gives birth to customer facing CMS, platform capitalism, and the beginning of a more centralized web content.

- Google doc technically is a very good example of updatable, living doc that can even be edited by anyone who comes across it on the internet without any authentication.

- This also relates back to ideas in InDesign, where contents are populated from spreadsheets rather than being directly punched into the file. There are variables, updatable.

- Example: connecting database to it? Currently not an example of p5.zine, or p5.book.

- Counter word: Immutability?

- **Who's updating it? Updated by the creator or <u>receiving community input?</u>** 

    - **<u>Inputability?</u>**

    - Participating

- **updatability → author/creator changing the framework**

### Examples 

- A website can keep updating its contents even after the link is 'published' or shared with viewers

evergreen vs real-time

who gets to update this??

## Reactivity

The ability for the viewer to give feedback to the medium and for the medium to adopt the feedback in real time

I separate this from updatability, because to me what is updateable is more related to the content whereas adaptability is more related to the display.

For instance a book can be adaptable to different printing methods or sizing, however the content always stays the same, it's the display that's changing and fits into the final production form or material form. Just like how responsive website doesn't really change its content based on the windows screen size. 

Adaptable could also be happen immediately or learn later. If a user can filter out content or decide what content to display right now, this is something that happens immediately. However the book can also grow and learn in a longer time frame, by learning user behaviors and change the order of itself, which doesn't happen immediately but it's still considered a feedback loop that is adaptable. 

- This is not a yet documented concept in p5.zine as well.

- Counter-word: fixed

- **Reactivity - react to the public / framework**

### Examples 

- A database than is sortable through different criteria allows the viewer to re-organize the content through their understanding of the work

- A performer being able to answer questions and react to the feedback from an audience

## (Tele)Portability

The ability to navigate within a work by pinpointing areas of interest and directly jumping to them

Searchable to me is more about indexing and rather than about searching.

When the Internet was first created Tim berners Lee also created HTML as part of the protocol that can help find different objects that are being saved in the server. So his idea was that we can just create an index that can house all these different objects, and that is also why he created hyperlinks, and why till this day the first page of any website is still called index.html.

A book will usually have a content page that is almost serving as an index. However there are also other ways that an index can point to other things, for instance, a QR code that can point to a video, or an embedded YouTube player that is inside the page. 

Some project experiment this with the idea of iframe, so we can embed websites inside websites. Others make spreadsheets, where the publishing methods is less focusing on doing its own project and more focusing on cataloging and archiving other people's projects.

The idea of indexing also reminds me of web scrapers and API calls. For instance we can technically make a book that just keeps archiving and indexing all the images there being added to the Met API 

There's also reminds me of data structure. Maybe it's less about calling other people's API but maybe the publishing can become an API itself? Many websites and personal blocks have RSS feed or exposed sitemap.

This is also not a feature that is documented in p5.zine

- **Indexable, Catalogable?????** \
    The link is coming to you? 

- The index contains other things than it self. it portals you to other things or it brings those things to you.

### Examples 

- A google doc is searchable through the 'find' feature

- A catalogue is searchable through its index

## Traceability

The ability to record the path and interactions of a viewer while they are using a medium

I think I'll traceability is less about interactions of the user, the more about the traceability of different versions of the book. So is it possible to keep a changelog every possible iteration of this specific book, and what are some of the decisions behind this. 

There's a lot of publishing tool that can enable this function for instance things like notion and Google doc they're almost kind of serving us and public forum / publishing tool. They're also custom built functions for instance one that can enable translations with different progress like approved or revert back to back log discussion.

Traceability also in some ways definitely guarantees the idea of who's the last one who edited it and so there's that multi author multi-user aspect in it already. 

The timestamp also documents how long it takes for this book from concepting to publishing, and how outdated the content maybe. It almost is definitely relating to transparency, and also in some ways update ability. 

This is not a feature yet documented.

I would like to brainstorm some other ideas where maybe this is untangled from updateability, or the traceability is not related to timestamp.

**Not related to updatability or timestamp:**

- What pages have you read?

- The cover of the book is red dye, when you're handling the book your fingers will get stained and you will stain all the pages you look at.

### Examples 

- Version history

- The pdf export feature of the web version of the cyber feminism index

## Parallel Histories

To better understand these affordances, it might be interesting to look into the parallel Histories of digital and analogue technologies that influenced Hybrid publishing practices and how they fit into the affordances

**Technologies/concepts to research**

- Hyperlinks (& CSS/HTML)

- E-readers

- Print on demand

- Non-proprietary design tools

- P5

- Bootlegs

- zine practices

- desktop publishing

- Web 1(Internet as index) /Web 2/ Web 3

This project — a broadcast, a book, and a download — restores access to 1,964 climate change-related URLs that were removed from EPA.gov on April 28, 2017. The URLs point to web pages, documents, presentations, publications, and other files that were purged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the direction of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and the Trump administration. Some of the assets had been accessible on the web since 1997.

This book questions the 'ownability' of information on the web by capturing articles that were removed from EPA.gove and publishing them in book form. While published on the web, while the reader has temporary access to those articles they can also be removed by the host organization, the reader has no control on their continued access to the content. But when the articles are printed, their distribution is a more permanent act, the book can owned and stored solely by the reader, making interference from the publisher impossible.

## Updatability

While all print is inherently updatable through the re-printing of editions or a newspaper model of subscriptions perhaps these gestures are about making this updatability more visible to the reader. Conveying the possibility of an update and making the update central to the structure of the content.

**Gestures**

- Modular editions

- Incomplete layouts

- Adaptable containers

If  the second edition is already decided is it areally an update

make room for an insert system

## Example

[A Party to Print](https://raphaelbastide.com/workshops/a-party-to-print/)

The current libre and open source toolset allows pushing the boundaries of book making. During the last 10 years, in a wish to go beyond limits imposed by proprietary software, designers, artists and collectives researched new ways of thinking the publishing chain. PrePostPrint, initiated by Sarah Garcin and Raphaël Bastide in 2017 is a network made up of such people, events and tools. The collective shares ways of crafting graphic objects, with alternative, libre or DIY tools or made in a certain context constrained by its economy, its emergency or its collaborative nature. The Seminar A Party To Print was given in this context of experimental publishing, free software, and collaboration.

A party to print is a generative project, where the interactions of a party are actively creating content for the book as the party is happening. Through the capturing of images, audio and data the contents of the book then are direct products of the interactions of the users (the guests) with the medium (the party)

[Cyberfeminism Index](https://cyberfeminismindex.com)

The print version of the cyberfeminsim index, looks to recreate the (tele)portability of the html link through a series if in text annotations. Through the integration of the index system into the content, the experience of the book creates direct portals between related ideas. These portals then encourage a non-linnear exploration of the index, creating a complex network akin to the structures of a web pages despite the conventionally sequential arrangement of book pages.

## Portability

The portability of the web is so marking because it allows for the compression of distance between pages, obfuscating the structural paths taken in the journey from one place to another. Although it isn't possible to completely obfuscate this structure in a printed book because of the physical presence of the pages perhaps we can integrate the portals into the physical form of the book, allowing for readers to forgo the 'browsing' of the content.

[Cyberfeminism Index](https://cyberfeminismindex.com)

The Web version of the cyber feminism index has a feature where every time you open a drop down, it adds that article to a table of contents which you can then download as an aggregate pdf. While it is possible to retrace your steps on most website either through your browsing history of meta-data, the trace of a user's path is usually not visible to the user themselves. This feature is actively creating visible 'residue' attached to user interactions in order to make a visible 'trace' of the act of reading/exploring/browsing.

## Traceability

While traceability has become a given for the web as a medium due to its mutability, print is usually restricted due to its immutability. While the book is meant to be interacted with, read, paged through, carried around etc... whether or not it should show signs of those interactions is controversial. Some view books as a pristine medium, meant to be preserved in the same state as when it was first printed, making even a simple dog-ear on a page a blasphemous act. But what if it is that very immutability, becomes a tool for traceability? If the the only way to interact with a book become through irreversible gestures, then the book itself become a series of residues, traces of what the reader has seen, read absorbed, interacted with.

How can we create a book where the reader leaves a trace?  How can the existing interactions we have with a book be made to leave behind residue?

**Interactions:**

- Page turn

- Opening and closing the book

- skimming the page with your fingers

**Gestures**

- Tearing

- Folding

- heat??

- smudging

- scratching

'A material medium in an immaterial age'

'What does it mean to create an alternatve publication?

to challenge the prevailling medium 

to formulate a new original aesthetic based on the new medium's qualities

to generate content which is relevant to the contemporary situation'

'publishing is no longer a question of readership but of resonance'

'There is no one-way street from analog to digital; rather, there are trasnitions between the two, in both directions. Digital is the paradigm for content and quantity of information; analog in the paradigm for usability and interfacing.'

**Chapter 4: The end of paper: can anything actually replace the printed page?**

- The mimicry of print by the digital devices meant to replace them (e-books, e-paper. kindles etc..) looks to leverage the familiarity the user already has with the format of print and the expanded possibilities of the digital device to create a new experience.

- Digital reading means the loss of the ‘set scale’, requiring adaptability and reflowability from text and content.

- The change in our relationship to print also affected the physical spaces that were built to accommodate a print world (Libraries becoming more and more digital)

- The ‘elitization’ of print. As print becomes less of a necessity and more of a possibility, the print object is elevated from mundane to art object. This way even the print that isn’t replaced by the digital is inherently changed (different aura)  by the pressence of the digital

- The environmental impact of digital work is more opaque but nevertheless still present while the physicality of the printed medium makes direct links to it’s resource requirements

- The online archiving of print materials allows for wider access and distribution and while in theory could be seen as detrimental to the sales of the original, these ‘bootlegs’ often end up promoting the work of the author and acting as an entry way for viewers.

- The print archiving of digital tools for posterity sake is essential to the conservation of these digital works. The reliability of the digital of different layers of technology to access (hardware, software, plug-ins etc..) means there are several possibilities for the work to be suddenly inaccessible and so it must be ‘immortalized’ in a medium outside of digital

- The importance of ‘grassroots’ archival practices that focus on indie publications or artists are essential in the preservation of collective memory

**Chapter 6:** _The network: transforming culture, transforming publishing_

- Smaller publishing practices while not expansive actually act as nodes within a larger network of publication practices connected via collaborations and mutual support

- This network is supported by larger actors like directories, grants, agencies and syndications that connect these smaller endeavors together and provide resources for the publication of these

- Collaboration across borders allows for the expansion of the creative network

**“Source, Code, Print” is a research and design project that explores the evolving role of publishing in an era where digital and physical media are deeply intertwined. Rather than seeing print and digital as opposing forms, this project examines how they overlap, coexist, and mutually inform each other, shaping how knowledge, culture, and creative work are produced, circulated, and received.**
